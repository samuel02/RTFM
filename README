RTFM-Core v1.0 Per Lindgren (C) 2014
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
History
2014-07-18			v1.0 development branch

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DISTRIBUTION AND DIRECTORY STRUCTURE
RTFM-core			RTFM-core compiler v1.0
->src				source files
				./make to build compiler script
				./make X build applicaiton X script
				./makedot X build application X with dot out
				./makeinstall <path>
				copies "core" to directory <path> 

PTCORE				RTFM-core Pthread run-time (OSX/Linux)
->RTFM_SRC			Source .core files (including examples)
->RTFM_PT			Pthread run-time
->Application			Used for the autogenerated autogen.c
->Debug				./make to build and run application
				./makedebug to build and run in debug mode

RTFM-KM3			RTFM-core ARM Cortex M3 Kernel

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PREPARATION OSX

OSX-MAVERICS 10.9
XCode				Latest XCODE command line tools
XQartz 2.7.6			Optional (used e.g., by ZATHURA)

OSX port installations 		Please refer to general info on OSX PORT system

sudo port install ocaml	       	OCAML compiler
sudo port install opam	        We use OPAM for the OCAML related installations
opam init 	  	        The OPAM system needs to be initially configured
opam config env		        run after OPAM init
opam install menhir	        Our Parser generator (installs ocamlfind also)

This should be enough to build and run the RTFM-core compiler under OSX

sudo port install graphviz      Used to compile generated .dot files 
     	  	  	        (this package has a lot of dependencies so it 
			        takes a while to install)
sudo port install graphviz-gui  Optional
sudo port install zathura*      ZATHURA is a lightweight pdf viewer that can be 
     	  	  	        used instead of the built in OSX preview 
			        (* makes it install some plugins needed)
			        Uses X11
 
PREPARATION LINUX
Ubuntu 12.04/14.04		Should work on any modern LINUX

sudo apt-get install ocaml	OCAML compiler
sudo apg-get install opam	We use OPAM for the OCAML related installations
opam init 	  	        The OPAM system needs to be initially configured
opam config env		        run after OPAM init
opam install menhir	        Our Parser generator (installs ocamlfind also)
